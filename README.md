# Input-and-Output-in-C-
Input and output are critical pieces of C++ programs (or any program). In C++, input/output (I/O) is handled through streams, which are really modes of data transmission. The class iostream supports I/O operations. The key child classes for input are cin, and for output the class is cout.
